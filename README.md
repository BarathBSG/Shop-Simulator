This program simulates a function of a shop on the command-line, using data about customers and transactions from an example day contained in text files.

Each customer is given a transactions account with money to operate with the shop, and there are different types of accounts available - Some may be eligible for discounts.

Things like sugar tax and hot food heating charges have also been simulated.

Simulation.java conducts a full day's simulation, providing successful and unsuccessful transactions alongside a brief summary of the shop's turnover and things like the negative balances count..
